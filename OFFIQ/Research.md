# Final summary

	There are several websites offering ecommerce service for office equipments
	i researched on several popular ones and most of them was not completly dedicated for 
	office equipments , some had service of repair but didnt had online booking for those
	hence i would like to plan a project of ecommerce application dedicated for office
	equipments with a booking of repair service online. Will try to make the UI more 
	interactive and simple for easy and good user experience.
	Will try to implement maximum features in a minimal simple design including filtering 
	and personal recommendations.
